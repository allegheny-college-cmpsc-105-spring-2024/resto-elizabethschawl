Love the pastries and coffee here, always stop by before work. Love to see my favorite 
baristas, the shop cat, and the owner. There's also a cat cafe around the corner, love this corner of
 town. Crazy prices, good food, and a fav in general. Wish there was a more expansive menu. 
Love the support for local artists with using handmade ceramic plates and mugs. Amazing place
to be when it's warm outside and you can use the outdoor seating. Will bring my family and friends!
My favorite is the lavendar vanilla honey chocolate macademia nut wholesome cozy 
warm firelight nutty orange lemon lime hazelnut iced latte with pistachio, almond, 
cashew, nut butter cold foam and caramel, dulce de leche, caramelized sugar, 
brown butter drizzle.
