Looking at the data below, the number of site visitors is broken down into regions. This is 
incredibly helpful as a store/shop owner would be able to know which country to appeal to, 
where they can expand, and what nationalities they should not focus on. 
It would be astronomically helpful with an online vendor, as they would be able to 
hone advertising strategies and target customer bases. They would also be able to
alter their site to accomodate each region, with different languages and curriencies. 
This data visualization qualifies a quantity, making it a very useful tool in making 
a business more efficient and specialized. The real time aspect of Google Analytics
means that a different graph, maybe one that captures the time when users visit,
would also be very useful in collaboration with 
this data, as a business owner could know when each country most frequently views
their page.
